MKC = multilingual keyless ciphers
IP cams = Internet Protocol cams

I'm trying to eliminate the major insecurity linked with the IP cams these
days which is plain text communication. Platform here just doesn't mean the
security vulnerabilities but the optimal communication system using both
synchronous and asynchronous communication. As of now P2P doesn't seem to be a
valid use case here. But then as usual I'm never sure about what I might need in future.
